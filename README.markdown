Intervalometer
==============

Intervalometer is a small app making interval exercises easy to time. The app will give an audio signal at the end of each interval letting you know when it's time to change task or rest.

Add any number of intervals, when the end of the set is reached the timer loops around and starts over at the first set interval.

The App is still in it's infancy and are missing several important features and there is a heap of bugs. However the app does what it intends to do and works (at least for me).

Any bug reports, feature requests or Android programming pointers are welcome!
